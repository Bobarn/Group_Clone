# Welcome to [Itsy]

Our site's goal was to emulate the features of Etsy by allowing you to browse products and sell your own!

## How to Use

1. You can use the Categories bubbles or the Categories dropdown to view the different categories of products we have available.

2. Once you log-in, you'll be able to add to cart, purchase, view your orders, and favorite items by clicking the hearts on an item!


3. You can log in or sign-up by clicking on the profile button in the top right of the site. Once you provide the information requested, you'll be redirected to the home page and have full access to the rest of those features mentioned before.

4. Your orders, favorited items, and purchases can all be seen if you navigate from the profile dropdown in the top right. Your cart is also visible when viewing a product page and you can checkout once inside.

# Technologies Used

1. We made full use of Javascript and react-redux to store and retrieve state.

2. Python's flask and SQLAlchemy to build our database and run our backend routes.

3. We also used packages like the react responsive carousel and react star ratings packages to display our images and give an interactive visual.

# Highlights and Features

We were able to implement:
- Favorited Items with CRD

- Orders stored in database with a Cart in Local Storage to emulate full CRUD

- Products with Full CRUD

- Reviews with Full CRUD

# Challenges
- Ensuring we were all on the same page about the functions of the backend

- There were constant modifications that needed to be made to our thunks and routes in the beginning to ensure we got all the information we really wanted.

# Future Expansions

- AWS support (something we unfortunately did not plan for and were unable to approach until the tail-end of the sprint period)

- Pagination on categories pages

- Store pages for each seller

- Functioning search feature

- Image updates/removal
